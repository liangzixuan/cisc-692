# Evaluation Rubric

For each model output, assign a score from **1 (Poor)** to **5 (Excellent)** on the following criteria.  

| Criterion   | 5 – Excellent                                                                 | 4 – Good                                                      | 3 – Adequate                                                    | 2 – Needs Improvement                                           | 1 – Poor                                                       |

| **Accuracy**   | All bullets are fully supported by the source text; no errors or hallucinations. | Minor factual detail missing or slight error, but overall correct. | One bullet has a factual mistake or omission.                   | Multiple bullets contain errors or unsupported claims.          | Bullets are largely incorrect or hallucinated.                |
| **Relevance**  | Exactly the top 3 most important points are captured; nothing irrelevant.     | Covers main points, with one minor less-important detail.     | Covers two main points well; one bullet is borderline or less relevant. | Only one bullet is on‐point; others are tangential.             | Bullets are off‐topic or irrelevant.                         |
| **Clarity**    | Language is crystal‐clear: concise phrasing, no ambiguity.                   | Very clear, with one phrase that could be more precise.       | Generally understandable but somewhat wordy or vague.           | Hard to parse; awkward phrasing or run‐on language.            | Bullets are confusing or meaningless.                         |
| **Brevity**    | Every bullet ≤ specified word limit exactly.                                | One bullet slightly exceeds limit (≤5 words over).            | Two bullets exceed limit by a few words each.                   | More than two bullets exceed limit by a significant margin.     | Bullets totally ignore the word‐count constraint.             |
| **Structure**  | Exactly 3 bullets, proper “– ” prefix, no extra text before/after.          | 3 bullets used, minor formatting glitch (e.g. extra space).   | 3 bullets but inconsistent formatting (e.g. missing dash).      | Wrong number of bullets (2 or 4) or mixed formatting styles.    | Response not in bullet form.                                 |

**How to Apply:**  
1. Read the response carefully.  
2. For each criterion, choose the score that best matches the description.  
3. Record the five scores alongside the response for quantitative comparison.  
4. Use average scores across your 5–10 test inputs to identify your top‐performing prompt variant.  
5. In your write‐up, show the average scores per variant and justify your winner selection.
