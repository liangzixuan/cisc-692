Abstract: This paper explores the integration of artificial intelligence in education systems.

Introduction:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the field of education. The use of intelligent systems has enabled more personalized and adaptive learning experiences. With the advent of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing, educators can now provide targeted feedback, monitor student performance in real-time, and automate administrative tasks. Furthermore, AI tools can help identify learning gaps and recommend appropriate resources, thereby supporting student success. Despite these advantages, the integration of AI raises concerns about data privacy, bias in algorithms, and the digital divide. Ongoing research is needed to ensure that AI applications in education are equitable, transparent, and beneficial to all stakeholders.
