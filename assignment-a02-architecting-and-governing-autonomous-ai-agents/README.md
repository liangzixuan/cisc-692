## Developers Track-Specific Task
Build a rational intelligent agent system that performs an end-to-end workflow. This agent should:
- Retrieve, update, or log data using at least two distinct storage styles (e.g., SQL + in-memory cache or NoSQL)
- Make decisions using a behavior tree or function-triggered logic
- Demonstrate batch or stream handling
- Respect identity governance via a mock credential or access scope
- Include an internal policy enforcement point (e.g., restrict action if “risk_score > threshold” or "no token provided")
- Please carefully review the rubric aligned to your track before you begin—your deliverables, tools, and evaluation criteria are tailored to reflect your background and expected approach.
